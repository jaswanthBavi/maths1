Subject: Requesting permission for half day leave

 

Dear Sir,

I am writing to request permission to take a half day’s leave from work tomorrow as I have to be present at the Parent-Teacher meeting. The meeting will be held at 2pm.

I have a document to proofread that is due tomorrow. I will see to it that I finish it by 12 pm tomorrow and submit it for further review before I leave for my son’s school. I request you to kindly consider my request and allow me a half day leave for tomorrow.

Thanking you

Yours sincerely,

Signature

RAAM KUMAR
